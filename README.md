## crell
crell with a *tilt* style attack/decay input and a max-envelope-time input

- in1: Attack/Decay shape tilt (-5V - +5V)
- in2: Total envelope length (0V - 10V)
- out1: Envelope
- out2: Random voltages (-2V - 2V)
- out3: Random voltages (0V - 10V)
- out4: Clock pulse

## crell_ad

crell with discrete attack and decay inputs

- in1: Attack time (0V - 10V)
- in2: Decay time (0V - 10V)
- out1: Envelope
- out2: Random voltages (-2V - 2V)
- out3: Random voltages (0V - 10V)
- out4: Clock pulse
